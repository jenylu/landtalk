This map is made by observers, usually older people, who are sharing stories about changes they have noticed in a place outdoors. This could be a place where they live, work, farm, garden, or some other place that they have observed for a long time.  The site was set up to encourage younger and older people to talk together, and find out what they know.  It is maintained by Stanford University. For more information, please write to us at landtalk at stanford dot edu.
